<summary><strong>Arrays in FAANG Interviews</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

Arrays are one of the most foundational data structures in DSA and often dominate the early rounds of FAANG interviews. Below is a comprehensive list of array topics, from basics to advanced, that you should master.

### 1. Fundamentals & Operations
- Declaration, initialization, traversal
- Access by index (`O(1)` time complexity)
- Modification & update of elements
- Array memory model & fixed size property

### 2. Core Patterns & Algorithms
- **Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search (for sorted arrays)
- **Reversal & Rotation:** Reverse an array (in-place / extra space), Rotate array by `k` positions
- **Prefix Sum & Difference Array**
- **Sliding Window Techniques**

### 3. Sorting Techniques
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort (time/space complexity & stability)
- Counting Sort, Radix Sort
- Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag problem)
- Custom sorting problems

### 4. Classic Problem Patterns
- Two pointers
- Frequency maps / Hashing on arrays
- Prefix and Suffix arrays
- Kadane’s Algorithm (maximum subarray sum)
- In-place updates (without extra space)

### 5. Key Interview Problem Types
- Second Largest / Third Largest Element
- Reverse Array in Groups
- Move All Zeroes To End
- Wave Array / Alternate Positive Negative
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Stock Buy and Sell (single/multiple transactions)
- Majority Element / Majority Element II
- Product of Array Except Self
- Maximum Subarray / Product Subarray
- Container with Most Water
- Trapping Rain Water
- Merge / Insert Intervals
- Missing and Repeating Elements / Ranges
- Sum of All Subarrays / Subarrays with Product < K
- Minimize / Maximize array transforms (Swaps, Flips, Grouping)

### 6. Advanced Patterns
- Greedy algorithms: Picking elements with constraints
- Bit manipulation: XOR / AND / OR / bitmask on arrays
- Binary search on answers: Range-based array queries
- Interval problems: Merge intervals, schedule overlaps

### 7. Matrix (2D Array) Topics
- Traverse matrix in spiral order
- Transpose, rotate, or search in matrix

### How To Practice?
- **Start with Easy:** Reverse, find largest/smallest, search, rotate.
- **Progress to Medium:** Kadane’s, stock buy/sell, remove duplicates, two-pointer tricks.
- **Finish with Hard:** Trapping rain water, sliding window maximization, interval merges.
